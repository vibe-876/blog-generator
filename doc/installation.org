#+title: Installation

In the root directory of the project.

#+begin_src shell
  git clone https://github.com/vibe-876/blog-generator
  cd blog-generator
  lein uberjar
  cp target/uberjar/<jar-file> <somewhere-in-your-path>
#+end_src

If you use Emacs, I'd recommend also loading [[file:~/Programming/Projects/blog-generator/camarkup-mode.el][the mode]] for camarkup somewhere in your ~init.el~.
If you don't use Emacs, your options are call the jar manually (the Emacs mode is just a wrapper around the jar), or write a plug-in for your editor of choice.

I might make a more "official" download method at some point, that'll be in the 1.0 release.
