In the root directory of the project.

  cd blog-generator
  make
  sudo make install

Then, load the elisp program somewhere in your ~init.el~.
If you don't use Emacs, your options are call the jar manually (the Emacs mode is just a wrapper around the jar), or write a plug-in for your editor of choice.

I might make a more "official" download method at some point, that'll be in the 1.0 release.
